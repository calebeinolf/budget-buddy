# I want a truly simple budgeting app—

is that too much to ask for? Apparently. All the apps I tried were just TOO good. All I wanted was to set a budget and track my spending. No complicated categories or telling it my net worth, just a hard line on how much I can spend. Preferably with some super simple UX and UI.

&nbsp;
## Control your spending with Ctrl+Spend

This simple web app is meant to be used on mobile, with a familiar caculator-stlye input for adding transactions. After you type the amount, just choose a label to describe, and that it!
The budget page is just as simple— It tells you in simple, large numbers how much money you have left. Underneath you'll find a list of the month's transactions.

&nbsp;
## Quality of life features

Ok, I do need more than just a list of this month's transactions, though. Since I've already gone through the trouble, I'll throw in some bonus features, too:
- **Spending/Budget History** - see how much you spent in previous month + their budgets. Or, just view the full list of all your bad purchases.
- **Fancy Home page** - featuring a battery (showing the percent of budget left) and a widget with last month's spending (to make you feel bad about going over budget).
- Settings
  - **Edit monthly/yearly budget** - no cheating!
  - **Edit Transaction Labels** - make custom preset labels with unique colors. Drag and drop to move them around. You can always type a custom one when adding a transaction.
  - **Edit budget warnings** - you can change the percentage or dollar amount at which some text/progress bars/widgets turn yellow and red.
  - **Deleted Transactions** - view/restore deleted transactions
